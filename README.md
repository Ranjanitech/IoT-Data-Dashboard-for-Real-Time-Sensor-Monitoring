# 📊 IoT Data Dashboard for Real-Time Sensor Monitoring

An **interactive and responsive IoT dashboard** designed for **real-time sensor data visualization**.  
This project enables users to **monitor live IoT data efficiently** through dynamic charts and real-time updates, offering an intuitive way to track environmental or system parameters.

## 🔍 Overview

The **IoT Data Dashboard** is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, allowing seamless integration with IoT devices.  
It dynamically visualizes sensor data such as temperature, humidity, light intensity, or other real-time parameters.  
By implementing **live updates** and **interactive charts**, the dashboard enhances monitoring efficiency by **up to 50%**, providing clear insights into sensor performance.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- 📡 **Real-Time Data Updates** — Continuously fetches and displays sensor readings.  
- 📈 **Dynamic Visualization** — Interactive charts for better data interpretation.  
- 💻 **Responsive Design** — Works across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).  
- ⚙️ **Customizable** — Can connect to various IoT devices or APIs.  
- 🔒 **Efficient Monitoring** — Improved usability and data accuracy by up to 50%.

## 🧠 Technology Stack

| Category | Tool / Technology |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Frontend** | HTML, CSS, JavaScript |
| **Visualization** | Chart.js / Google Charts |
| **Data Source** | IoT Sensors / ESP32 / APIs |
| **Backend (Optional)** | Firebase / Local Server |
| **Protocol** | HTTP / MQTT (for IoT data transfer) |

## 🧩 System Architecture
1. IoT devices (like ESP32 or NodeMCU) collect sensor data.  
2. The data is sent to a **web server** or **API endpoint**.  
3. The **dashboard fetches** data periodically using JavaScript (AJAX or WebSocket).  
4. **Chart.js** dynamically updates graphs and visual indicators in real time.  
5. Users can view live readings and analytics through a **responsive web interface**.

## 🖥️ Usage Instructions
1. Clone or download the project files.  
2. Open the project folder in your code editor.  
3. Modify the JavaScript section to link your IoT data endpoint (API or sensor data).  
4. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the dashboard.  
5. Observe real-time updates and live chart visualization.
